What do I need to build?

You may need the EAZFuscator version 3.2 (Release version from Sept. 2011) for building release version (can be removed in post build), because the current Beta version has an issue in reflecting the xaml code.

I found a bug, what should I do?

You can add them to the issue page here in github or try to fix it by forking the project and create a pull request ;).
